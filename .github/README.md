# RADIO (Radio Automated Digital Intelligence Operator)

RADIO is an AI-driven ham radio operator project designed to automate interactions and integrate AI services into ham radio operations. This project uses the ESP8266 microcontroller, adding AI capabilities like text-to-speech and dynamic audio management to enhance the amateur radio experience.

## Features

- **Automated Text-to-Speech (TTS) Response**: Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate speech responses from text.
- **Web Server Integration**: Hosts a local web server on the ESP8266 for easy interaction and configuration.
- **Dynamic Audio Handling**: Manages audio input and output, responding to received transmissions and playing back generated audio responses through an external DAC.
